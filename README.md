Analogy Farm was a popular puzzle from the 2013 MIT Mystery Hunt. The puzzle is
a web application; your goal is to interact with the web application until the
answer becomes clear. The answer is a single word.

`solution.txt` and `solved.svg` contain spoilers, if you couldn't tell from the
filenames.

Interesting features of the code
================================

* The app maintains state in a SQLite database, and updates it live. If you and
  someone else are solving the same instance of the puzzle, and they fill in a
  box, you see the box update in your browser.
* The boxes you fill in on the page are auto-generated by finding the rectangles
  in `solved.svg`, in the script `parse_svg.py`.
* It actually survived the load of the Mystery Hunt.

Interesting misfeatures of the code
===================================

* The `parse_svg` script generates .json, and you need to add an assignment to
  it to make it a valid .js file. Oops.
* Static file paths are hardcoded.

To do
=====

* Get it hosted again, probably in a gunicorn + WSGI setup
  (There's a server available for this purpose, if someone figures out the
  configuration)
* Make it so that a single copy of the software can host multiple "teams"
  of progress
* Add a reasonable way to reset progress
