This is a Funny Farm-style game, where parallelograms made of two black lines
and two red lines are SAT-style analogies.

For example, you start with:

sun : jupiter :: ? : charon

When you fill in the answer "pluto" and hit enter, the server confirms it. It
also fills in "pluto" in another blank that's connected by a blue line,
representing equality.

When you fill in a blank on one end of a gray dotted line, it will fill in the
unrelated blank on the other end, making more of the graph solvable.


Here are the analogies in the upper left, for example:

mit : engineers :: harvard : crimson        = names of sports teams
mit : tech :: harvard : crimson             = names of newspapers
harvard : crimson :: mit : cardinal/gray    = school colors
spare : strike :: slash : x                 = bowling symbols
cardinal : card :: technical : tech         = informal four-letter abbreviations


Other analogies (skipping over some obvious ones):

ecstasy : x :: head rat : r :: middle eastern : t = the single letter this would be in a cryptic clue

time : t :: displacement : x                    = standard variable name for this axis

blood : iron :: speeches : majority decisions   = a quote by Bismarck

sega : saturn :: atari : jaguar                 = unsuccessful fifth-generation consoles

atari : go :: check : chess                     = name of a threatening position in a game

go : china :: chess : india                     = country of origin

chinese : master wok :: middle eastern : sepal  = "ethnic" fast-food restaurants at the CambridgeSide Galleria

sonic : coins :: leaps : sepal                  = the result of applying a 12345 -> 52431 permutation

sonic boom : sound :: cherenkov radiation : light
    = X happens when things move faster than the local speed of Y

saturn : sky :: honda : civic                   = make, model of cars

guns/roses : axl :: black/sabbath : ozzy        = lead singer

black : sabbath :: technical : ecstasy :: chinese : democracy :: guns : roses
    = These are highly-anticipated, long-delayed, and ultimately disappointing
      albums by the named bands.

bono : edge :: axl : slash                      = lead singer vs. guitarist

hack : crack :: white hat : black hat
    = verbs techies wish you would use when distinguishing non-malicious from malicious hacking

titanium : chromium :: chromium : iron          = add two protons

chrome : chromium :: red hat : fedora           = related commercial and open-source projects

red hat : head rat :: al gore : galore          = spoonerisms

al gore : algorithm :: log : logarithm          = what it sounds like when you add 'rhythm'

logarithm : corollary :: logarhythms : chorallaries = MIT a cappella groups with punny mathy names

chorallaries : hot air balloon :: logarithms : black balloon
    = tracks named with 'balloon' that the respective groups have gotten on BOCA

pitch : black :: blood : red :: sky : blue      = descriptive color names

sun : jupiter :: pluto : charon :: saturn : titan = largest orbiting object

hack : hijack :: dorm : deform :: spider : stupider = change the first letter to three consecutive letters

college : dorm :: jail : cell                   = where you live

college : knowledge :: jupiter :: stupider      = where girls and boys go and why, according to a schoolyard rhyme

knowledge : power :: time : money               = adages connected by "is"

time : second :: power : watt :: distance : meter = metric units

distance : speed :: energy : power              = divide by time

distance : speed :: alone : need                = "Going the Distance" lyrics

distance : displacement :: speed : velocity     = scalar : vector

first : velocity :: second : acceleration :: third : jerk ...
    = names of derivatives of displacement, including the whimsical ones

soda : pop :: rotary : roundabout               = what things are called in New England vs. much of the Midwest

ace : acid :: arachne : arachnid                = change -e to -id

light : might :: lite : mite                    = increment first letter

light : lite :: might : mite                    = respell -ight as -ite

sage : mint :: spider : arachnid                = biological classification

speed : pace :: time : frequency                = reciprocal quantities

frequency : linear :: pitch : log               = scale these musical quantities are measured on

pace : peace :: fine : end                      = translate from Italian to English

line : linear :: end : final                    = adjective form


As you solve the puzzle, the nodes MIT, MITE, and FINAL are highlighted. Complete the analogy by calling in FINALE.
